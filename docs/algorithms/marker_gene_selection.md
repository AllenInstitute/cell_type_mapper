# Marker gene selection

In this page we document the algorithm used to select marker genes
for the cell type mapper. Code implementing this algorithm
is provided in this codebase as discussed
[here.](../input_data_files/marker_gene_lookup.md#creating-the-marker-gene-lookup-table)
In this page we will discuss the meaning of the various config
parameters used by the code explained in that page.
